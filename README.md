# Spokestack Android

Spokestack provides an extensible speech recognition pipeline for the Android
platform. It includes a variety of built-in speech processors for Voice
Activity Detection (VAD) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) via popular
speech recognition services, such as the Google Speech API and Bing Speech
API.

## Configuration

### Google Speech API

```java
SpeechPipeline pipeline = new SpeechPipeline.Builder()
    .setInputClass("com.pylon.spokestack.android.MicrophoneInput")
    .addStageClass("com.pylon.spokestack.libfvad.VADTrigger")
    .addStageClass("com.pylon.spokestack.google.GoogleSpeechRecognizer")
    .setProperty("google-credentials", "<google-credentials>")
    .setProperty("locale", "en-US")
    .build();
```

This example creates an active speech recognition pipeline using the Google
Speech API that is triggered by VAD. The `google-credentials` parameter should
be the contents of a Google Cloud service account credentials file, in JSON
format. For more information, see the [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/speech/docs/streaming-recognize).
See the [javadoc](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.pylon/spokestack) for
other component-specific configuration parameters.

### Microsoft Bing Speech API

```java
SpeechPipeline pipeline = new SpeechPipeline.Builder()
    .setInputClass("com.pylon.spokestack.android.MicrophoneInput")
    .addStageClass("com.pylon.spokestack.libfvad.VADTrigger")
    .addStageClass("com.pylon.spokestack.microsoft.BingSpeechRecognizer")
    .setProperty("sample-rate", 16000)
    .setProperty("frame-width", 20)
    .setProperty("buffer-width", 300)
    .setProperty("vad-rise-delay", 100)
    .setProperty("vad-fall-delay", 500)
    .setProperty("bing-speech-api-key", "<bing-api-key>")
    .setProperty("locale", "fr-CA")
    .build();
```

This example creates a VAD-triggered pipeline with custom rise/fall delays
using the Microsoft Bing Speech API. For more information on this API, check
out the [documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech/).

## Development
Maven is used for building/deployment, and the package is hosted at Maven
Central.

This package requires the [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/index.html)
to be installed and the `ANDROID_HOME` and `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` variables to be
set. On OSX, ANDROID_HOME is usually set to `~/Library/Android/sdk` and
ANDROID_NDK_HOME is usually set to `~/Library/Android/sdk/ndk-bundle`.

### Testing/Coverage

```bash
mvn test jacoco:report
```

### Lint

```bash
mvn checkstyle:check
```

### Release
Remove the -SNAPSHOT suffix from the version in `pom.xml`, then run the
following command. This will deploy the package to Maven Central.

```bash
mvn deploy
```

Use the Maven release plugin to tag the release and advance the version number.

```bash
mvn release:clean release:prepare release:perform
```
